# Mike's Classic Games using Godot

My implementation of classic video games I played in my childhood using the Godot game engine. Also an excuse for me to apply my knowledge in software engineering, computing theory, artificial intelligence, pixel art, music theory, and sound engineering. For educational purposes.

Each folder containing a `project.godot` file is a project meant to be used with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), the open source 2D and 3D game engine. Check out the `README.md` files in each of these projects for more details.

**Godot version: (4.2.1 release)**

## Importing all projects

To import all projects at once in the project manager:

- Clone this repository or [download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/miketvo/classic-games-godot/archive/main.zip).
  - If you've downloaded a ZIP archive, extract it somewhere.
- Open the Godot project manager and click the **Scan** button on the right.
- Choose the path to the folder containing all projects.
- All projects should now appear in the project manager.

## Try the games in your browser (Work-in-progress)

These games are hosted on [my personal blog](http://miketvo.github.io) with GitHub Pages. They can be viewed [here](https://miketvo.github.io/classic-games-godot/).

**Note:** The performance of Godot in a browser is lower than natively on desktop. For the best performance, consider downloading the games from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/miketvo/classic-games-godot/releases/latest/).
